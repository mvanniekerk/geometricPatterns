# Geometric Patterns Creator

A tool to create geometric patterns from circles and lines only. It is possible to create very complex patterns using just these two building blocks.

## Examples of patterns
![hex circles](/images/hex_circles.png)
![square pattern](/images/square_pattern.png)
![pentagons](/images/pentagons.png)
![hex lines](/images/hex_lines.png)
![square circles](/images/square_circles.png)

## Build

```bash
$ tsc
```

## But why?
As a kid a used to draw these things by hand for fun.

Also I wanted to learn a bit about JavaScript and the JS ecosystem, since I never created something longer than 50 lines with it (with typescript and strict type checking JS is much more fun than I expected).
